# CompRobo FA25: Robot Localization Project

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to implement a particle filter to localize a robot on a map, using Lidar sensor measurements
to iteratively obtain probabilistic estimates of position and orientation until we have successfully converged on the
robot's position.

We made the decision to stick with a normal Gaussian distribution to determine the weights of our particles.

## Challenges Faced

## Possible Future Improvements

Given more time, it could have been interesting to explore other weight distributions more in depth.
