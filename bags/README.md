### Computational Intro to Robotics: Robot Localization Bags

This directory contains ROS2 bag files used to test and validate our particle filter implementation across different scenarios and environments.

#### Gauntlet (`gauntlet_test`)
This bag file was recorded during a live teleoperation session in the Gazebo simulation of the Gauntlet environment. Using our previous teleoperation behavior code, we manually drove the Neato through various parts of the map while the particle filter ran in real-time. The particle filter demonstrated excellent performance, accurately converging on the robot's true location throughout the test.

#### MAC Take 1 (`mac_take_1_pf`)
This bag was created by running our particle filter on the original `macfirst_floor_take_1` bag file and recording the results. In this test scenario, the initial pose estimate was close to the robot's actual starting position, allowing the particle filter to quickly establish accurate localization and maintain it throughout the robot's movement.

#### MAC Take 2 (`mac_take_2_pf`) 
This bag was generated by running our particle filter on the `macfirst_floor_take_2` bag file. This test presented a more challenging scenario where the initial pose estimate was inaccurate. Despite the starting conditions, the particle filter successfully recovered and converged on the correct robot location as it gathered more sensor data and moved through the environment.
